Although you may not be aware, unless you yourself are an avid climber, Utah is a top-tier location for outdoor rock climbing. Just Central Utah boasts 801 rock routes (not including Boulders, Ice, Aid, or Mixed) available on the [Mountain Project.](https://www.mountainproject.com/)<br>

I'm going to filter the list slightly, and reduce it to "rock" routes (Trad or Sport or Toprope) in Central Utah, with a rating (difficulty) between 5.6 and 5.12a/b with at least 0 stars (community rating).
