Although you may not be aware - unless you yourself are an avid climber - Utah is a top-tier location for outdoor rock climbing. Just Central Utah boasts 801 rock routes (not including Boulders, Ice, Aid, or Mixed) available on the [Mountain Project.](https://www.mountainproject.com/)<br>

We could go ahead and scrape every climb in Central Utah, or even every climb in the entirety of Utah, but I decided to filter the routes a bit to climbs that I would likely be more interested in. I'm going to reduce it to "rock" routes (Trad, Sport, or Toprope) in Central Utah, with a rating (difficulty) between 5.6 and 5.12a/b with at least 0 stars (community rating). This filtering still leaves 623 climbs. The website itself defaults to sorting first by popularity, and then by difficulty. With this filter, I'm going to pull the top 200 routes.
