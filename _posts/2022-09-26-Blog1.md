Jupyter Notebook is a very popular way to run Python and is completely free software. Jupyter boasts "support of over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala. Interactive output with code that can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types. Big data integration
Leverage big data tools, such as Apache Spark, from Python, R, and Scala. Explore that same data with pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2, and TensorFlow." [Jupyter's Official Website](https://jupyter.org/)<br>
Although Jupyter has such incredible capabilities we will only be going over some of the basics.

Topics covered:
1. How to open a new notebook
2. Popular libraries to import
3. Your first Web Scrape

We won't cover the actual install of Jupyter Notebook because there as so many ways to do it depending on your needs and Operating System. If you haven't yet installed Jupyter, you can check out this short tutorial on youtube. <br> [How to Install Jupyter Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuTkAWEa06E)

### How to open a new notebook
Now that you have Jupyter Notebook installed, let's look at how to open a fresh notebook. In your terminal, simply enter the following:

This should start up a new kernal and redirect you to a newly created webpage. If the notebook was started in an empty directory, it will look something like this:

Head over to the right side and click new, then Python 3. <br>

You should now be looking at the start of your new, unnamed, empty notebook. You're ready to go! <br>

### Popular libraries to consider importing
Numpy is essential if you're going to be doing any sort of computation. In the first line of your new notebook, simply put in `import numpy as np`. Head on over here for a quick view at arithmetic now available with Numpy. [Numpy Basics](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/numpy-cheat-sheet-data-analysis-in-python?irclickid=yZGxP3VnvxyIR2TRSmUZGX%3A7UkDTvjQN2VKzTM0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact&utm_campaign=000000_1-2003851_2-mix_3-all_4-na_5-na_6-na_7-mp_8-affl-ip_9-na_10-bau_11-Bing%20Rebates%20by%20Microsoft&utm_content=BANNER) <br>

Another essential library is Pandas. Pandas is used primarily for the manipulation of data structures. Import it with `import pandas as pd`. Here's a quick tutorial on Pandas.

### Your first Web Scrape
Now lets get to the good stuff - Scraping the web. Even within Jupyter Notebooks there are many ways to do this. We will be using Beautiful Soup. 
First, a few import statements. For this quick tutorial we will need the following: <br>

*from bs4 import BeautifulSoup* <br>
*import requests* <br>
*import pandas as pd* <br>

Now we need to make the "Soup". We will be doing this demonstration on a simple table found in a wiki page. Let's look at some code. <br>
`url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_car_speed_record"` <br>
`data = requests.get(url).text` <br>
`soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')` <br>

Now let's take a look at the tables available to use in the soup. We are soon going to want information about the classes of each table, so let's print it out. Here is the code along with the results. <br>

We are going to pull in the first wikitable shown on the wiki page - the Record-Breaking Production Vehicles. <br>
`table = soup.find('table', class_='wikitable sortable')`
