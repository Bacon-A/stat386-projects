Jupyter Notebook is a very popular way to run Python and is completely free software. Jupyter boasts "support of over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala. Interactive output with code that can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types. Big data integration
Leverage big data tools, such as Apache Spark, from Python, R, and Scala. Explore that same data with pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2, and TensorFlow." [Jupyter's Official Website](https://jupyter.org/)<br>
Although Jupyter has such incredible capabilities we will only be going over some of the basics.

Topics covered:
1. How to open a new notebook
2. Most important keyboard shortcuts
3. Popular libraries to import
4. Basic arithmetic and syntax
5. Your first Web Scrape

We won't cover the actual install of Jupyter Notebook because there as so many ways to do it depending on your needs and Operating System. If you haven't yet installed Jupyter, you can check out this short tutorial on youtube. <br> [How to Install Jupyter Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuTkAWEa06E)

Now that you have Jupyter Notebook installed, let's look at how to open a fresh notebook. In your terminal, simply enter the following:

This should start up a new kernal and redirect you to a newly created webpage. If the notebook was started in an empty directory, it will look something like this:
