In our last blog post, we scraped some of Central Utah's best rock climbing routes. [(See previous blog post here)](https://bacon-a.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/20/WebScrape.html) <br>
Now, lets take a look at the data and see if we can find any interesting trends. I started off with just a few basic histograms to get a feel for the data. <br>

One of the first things I wanted to look at was the distribution of the user's ratings. As I reminder, I pulled the top 200 most popular routes in the area. I'm honestly a little bit surprised to see some routes with such low ratings. (Ratings can range from 0 to 4 stars)
