In our last blog post, we scraped some of Central Utah's best rock climbing routes. [(See previous blog post here)](https://bacon-a.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/20/WebScrape.html) <br>
Now, lets take a look at the data and see if we can find any interesting trends. I started off with just a few basic histograms to get a feel for the data. <br>

One of the first things I wanted to look at was the distribution of the user's ratings. As I reminder, I pulled the top 200 most popular routes in the area. I'm honestly a little bit surprised to see some routes with such low ratings. (Ratings can range from 0 to 4 stars) <br>

The good news though, is these ratings are pretty normally distributed. These are self given ratings, and it's good that we aren't seeing any large skews here. <br>

The next thing I wanted to check was the amount of routes in each climbing grade (Rating). If you look at the original data, or know how routes are graded, you will know that once routes reach 5.10 they are then further subdivided into 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, and 5.10d. This same pattern is used for all routes 5.10 and higher. In order to reduce the size of the x-axis, I combined all 5.10 routes into a 5.10 category, and did the same for the higher grades as well. <br>

You will noticed the large jump in number of routes once we reach 5.10. This is likely because of the combining that I just mentioned. This also may have to do with the jump in difficulty. "A 5.0 to 5.7 is considered easy, 5.8 to 5.10 is considered intermediate, 5.11 to 5.12 is hard, and 5.13 to 5.15 is reserved for a very elite few."
